# Bootcamp-Self-Assessment

Self-Assessment
My role in the project on the Titanic was primarily around data cleaning, SLQ writing and the development of the Readme.  
* Once we found the data needed, I worked to ensure that the data was usable for the machine learning model and the visualizations.  This included cleaning the data (formatting and missing information). 
* Once clean, I created the tables in PostgreSQL and pulled the data into the tables.  They were then combined using the unique identifier created by Katrina.  I then removed any data that was not part of the scope of the project.  These were primarily those that were not on the boat at the time of sinking.
* I assisted Sara with reviewing the machine learning model and ran other models that were not included in the final presentation.  This was done so that we could determine what the right model was for our data set. 
* I also assisted Katrina with the Tableau Dashboard and helped decide on which visualizations were appropriate.
* Finally, I was lead on the Readme with the assistance of editing from the team.

My greatest challenge over the course of the project was continuing to learn the machine learning models.  I also struggled with continuing to want to do more with the project which was more than what the rest of the team wanted to do.
 
Team Assessment
The team worked well together, except that we each had different expectations of how much we wanted to complete.  We did communicate well with each other as we were willing to share our honest opinions on how the project should go.  

After our presentation, I do wish that I had been a bit more assertive in getting the team to add some of the additional items suggested.  I know better and would do differently next time.  

Each of us were drawn to our strengths of the project (Katrina with Tableau, Sara with JupyterNotebook, and myself with SLQ).  We also challenged ourselves with something where we were not strong (Katrina with data cleaning, Sara with machine learning, and myself with the writing of the Readme).  We were also very eager to assist each other when struggling and worked to ensure that everything was completed as expected. 
 
Summary of Project
Our project was on the Titanic and how demographics impacted the survivability of the shipwreck.  We used PostgreSQL, JupyterNotebook, machine learning, and Tableau to present our findings.  We discovered that while demographics (age, gender, ticket class) played a role in survivability, the RandomForestClassifier (or any other model) does not predict future survivability.  There was total chaos on the boat, and who survived was not typical for that time period or today.
